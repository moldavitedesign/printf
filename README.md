# C Printf: Group project

Group members are Adaeze Nwaturuoacha and Temitope Aiyebogan
The \_printf function works exactly like the famous printf function.

## Example
\_printf("This is a character %c, and this is an integer %d.\n", 'H', 98);
Output: This is a character H, and this is an integer 98.

%c formats for character
%s formats for string
%d formats for integer
%i formats an integer to be printed in basde 10
