.SH NAME
_printf()

The _printf function echoes the functionality of printf().
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"

.B int _printf(const char \fI*format\fR,
.B ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
The functions in _printf() writes output according to a format as described below.

.B Return Value
.RS 3
Upon successful return, the functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.
.RE

.B Format of the format string
.RS 3
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more  directives: ordinary  characters  (not  %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching  zero  or  more subsequen arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
By default, the arguments are used in the order given.
.RE

.B The conversion specifier
.RS 3
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.B d, i
.RS 6
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.RE

.B c
.RS 6
The \fIint\fR argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.RE

.B s
.RS 6
The \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.RE

.B %
.RS 6
A '%' is written. No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specifications i '%%'.
.RE

.SH NOTES
Currently, the program doesn't account for flags, fields, precision, or length modifiers.

.SH EXAMPLE
.RS 3
To print a sentence with conversion specifiers:

.RE

.RS 8
#include "holberton.h"

_printf("The %s jumped %d times!", "dog", 4);
.RE

.RS 3
Output : "The dog jumped 4 times!"
